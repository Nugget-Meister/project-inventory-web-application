# The Gatorade Database
##### Created by Keith Camacho
## Intro
Welcome to the Gatorbase! Everything is Gatorade themed, even the forms!

As it stands you should see two small buttons on the left and right hand side of the screen.


### Show/Hide
These buttons will show and hide the Gatorades you have created and the form to make them respectively.

Flavorade - The Name of the Flavor you call your Gatorade. It must be at least 3 letters long. 

GatorPrice - How much will your Gatorade cost? A minimum of 100 cents is required for this entry to be accepted. 

GatorSize - The size of your beverage. You can choose between 12, 16 and 20 oz sizes

In Stock - Allows for a Yes or No input, determining if the item is still in stock.



Stretch Goals

 - Creating a responsive webpage with animated elements.
 - Allowing for the ability to edit existing resources with the already existing form
